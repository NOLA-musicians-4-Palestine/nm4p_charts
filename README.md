#Notes from Sept. 21, '24
##Todo:
Book per player:
* Part+Clef > Transposition

Find a way to generate transpositions dynamically:
* Put in key as a variable when calling lilypond
* Add key in header text
* Change file name to include key

Or do it by hand, case by case?

More semantic structure for files i.e. break out melodies into variables

Don't need chords as staves. Chords are just notes as letters. Find a way to print letters maybe.

Output individual songs:
* Score
* Parts
* Some common part transpositions

#For Boston
Goal is to share. Phone formatting and 8.5x11 formatting.
Elements:
* Parts in common keys, split up by song
* Probably not full score. 
* Create Folk Medley .ly files
